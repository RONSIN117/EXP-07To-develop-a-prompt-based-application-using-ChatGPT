# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.

# Register no.25014522

# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# Algorithm
1. Define Core Requirements: The objective is to design a personal productivity assistant. The core features must include: managing daily tasks, scheduling reminders, suggesting wellness tips, and answering general queries.

2. Formulate Master Prompt: A foundational prompt is designed to define the assistant's persona and core functions for the LLM.

Prompt: "Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user's changing preferences over time."

3. Develop Simple (Zero-Shot) Prompts: Construct initial, straightforward prompts for each core feature to test baseline functionality.

Task: "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM."

Schedule: "Schedule a meeting tomorrow."

Wellness: "Give me a wellness tip."

4. Develop Advanced (Refined) Prompts: Design more complex, context-aware prompts that require the LLM to use more advanced reasoning and adapt to user preferences.

Task: "Organize my tasks for today by priority and estimated time. I have 'Finish report' (high, 2 hours), 'Buy groceries' (low, 30 mins), and 'Team call' (high, 1 hour)."

Schedule: "Schedule a 'Project Sync' for 30 minutes tomorrow when both I and Alex are free, and notify me of any overlaps with my existing calendar."

Wellness: "I've only slept 5 hours and have a busy day. Suggest a few simple wellness tips to help me stay focused and manage my energy, adapting based on my previous feedback that I dislike meditation."

5. Simulate and Analyze Outputs: Execute both simple and advanced prompts using ChatGPT. The outputs are compared to demonstrate how advanced prompt design fosters more creative, practical, and personalized problem-solving.

# Conclusion
The experiment successfully demonstrated the development of a prompt-based personal assistant. The progression from simple to advanced prompts was critical. Simple prompts resulted in basic, literal outputs. In contrast, advanced, context-rich prompts enabled the LLM to provide genuinely helpful, creative, and adaptive responses for managing tasks, scheduling, and wellness. This shows that the "intelligence" and "practicality" of the application are not just in the LLM itself, but in the engineering of the prompts that guide it.

# Result: 
The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal assistant powered by large language models. Students were able to:
 Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.
 Foster creativity by designing features suited to their personal or academic lives.
 Learn prompt engineering techniques for optimal interaction with AI tools.
 Experience the versatility and utility of generative AI in solving everyday problems.
